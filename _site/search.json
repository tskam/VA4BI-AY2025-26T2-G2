    "text": "Course Assessment\nThe assessment of this course consists of four major components, namely: class participation, individual assignment, DataViz Makeover, visual analytics project. There will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\n\nClass Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\nPractice makes perfect. To help students develop strong hands-on skills in designing elegant and functional data visualisations using Tableau, during lesson, students are required to complete a series of in-class exercises using Tableau. The in-class discussion will focus on how to critic existing data visualisation and how to deliver effective visual communication. In general, these exercises are guided interactively. By the end of each lesson, students are required to publish their in-class exercise on Tableau Public.\n\n\nClass Test\nThere will be two Timed Individual Assessment in the form of DataVis Makeover exercises in this course. In each exercise, one or two data visualisations will be provided. Students are required to critique the original visualisation, propose specific improvements, and redesign the visualisation accordingly. This may involve retelling the original story more effectively or uncovering a new and meaningful story within the data.\nThe objective of the makeover is to improve upon the original visualisation. Students should clearly articulate what works, what does not work, why certain design choices are ineffective, and how the revised design addresses these issues. Wherever possible, students should work within the fields of the provided dataset. However, if supplementing the data enables a clearer or more compelling narrative, this is encouraged.\nYou are required to upload the makeover onto the dropbox of e-Learn (i.e. LMS) by the end of the assessment time.\n\n\nIndividual Assignments\nThere will be two assignments that are due throughout the term. Students may work together to help one another with computer or Visual Analytics issues and discuss the materials that constitute the assignment. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the assignment (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly forbidden. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s own.\nStudents are required to edit their assignment onto the coursework website. The submission should provide a detail and accuracy descriptions of the methodology and data visualisation techniques used, and the findings of the analysis. The assignment artifact due, on the other hands, is to be uploaded into the Assignment Dropbox strictly before the official due dates. Late work, will be severely penalised. Students must check and confirm on Wiki the assignment due dates.\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students first hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page\n\n\nGrading Summary\nThe grading distribution of this course are as follows:\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeights\n\n\n\n\nClass Participation\n10%\n\n\nIndividual Assignments\n40%\n\n\nClass Tests\n10%\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\n40%\n\n\n\nThere will be final examination for this course."

    "text": "Motivation of Visual Analytics\nThe World is full of charts that lie!\n\nWe need to get smarter about visual information\n\nIt is very common you see infographic of this kind appears on our daily newspaper. At a first glance, it seems making a lot of sense. But, when we try to take a closer look at the text and graph, you will notice that there are at least two major issues, one is related to truthfulness of the data visualisation and the second one is related to its clarity aspect. For example, the x-axis is showing quarterly time interval. But, the second sentence talks about “For the first half this year, Nodx fell 4.5 per cent compared with the same period last year.” which is not inline with what was shown on the x-axis. Furthermore, the values on the y-axis are in per cent. Hence the correct term should be percentage point instead of per cent because we are comparing the differences between two percentages.\nThis is what motivate me to design this course. This course is not about using Tableau or R to create beautiful data visualisation only. More importantly, it aims to embark you the skills of getting smarter when reading data visualisation. From today onwards, I would like to encourage you to take a good look at every data visualisation you come across and carefully evaluate them not only from their aestheticness only but also their clarity."

I call this Junk Chart. As we know, junk foods are very tempting but not healthy. Similar, Junk Charts tends to be very appealing but they are not useful to gain data understanding. For example, it is not possible for us to do an effective comparison between global sales revenue and reinvestment in R&D because of the inappropriate use of 3d bar chart.\nThe important take away from this slide is to avoid creating eye candy data visualisation.

It shows the results of five models output. Unfortunately, it is not easy to compare the differences between them. This is partly because the value range of their y-axis are not the same. Further more by stitching the line graph top down and next jump to the right fail for support effective comparison.\nThe data visualisation on the right is a makeover version. It was created using the trellis method of JMP Pro. In this case, all line graphs maintain the same value range. As a result, the data visualisation reveals the differences between the five models clearly.\nAlso, by arranging the model results from left to right according to their calibration, allows us to compare the performance of each model effectively."

As shown in the figure. In a knowledge discovery process, visual analytics provide data analysts useful understanding of the data. These understanding can be used to support effective model building.\nData visualisation also should be used to reveal modelling results. Furthermore, by using data visualisation to communicate complex modelling results to senior management, in general, are more effectively than showing them complex equations."

    "text": "What is Visual Analytics?\nVisual Analytics require a shift of mindset\n\n\nTraditionally, statistical graphics are used for visual communication alone. Visual Analytics require a major paradigm shift from visual communication to visual thinking. Data Visualisation or statistical graphics should be used to support data exploration and analysis instead of visual communication alone. Having said that, this does not mean that visual communication is no longer important. Instead, the new paradigm shift requires us to give equal focus on both visual thinking and visual communication."

The line graph on the slide is a good example. This is a trade balance line graph prepared by William Playfair in 1786. You probably have identify this chart as a common line graph. The horizontal axis is years, the vertical axis measures the volume of imports and export. When you take a good look at the graph, you will be very impressed by conscious effort given by the author to shade the space between the import and export lines. When the trade balance was against England, the area was shared in red and when the trade balance was in favour of England, the area was shaded in brown. With the advancement of graph drawing tools, sadly to say, we hardly see this carefully crafted line graph been used."

It was one of the many versions prepared by John Snow and published in 1854. If you take a closer look at the map, you will notice that it is not a normal dot map we commonly prepared using Google Map or other data visualisation toolkits like Tableau or PowerBI. In the map, cholera cases are highlighted in black, showing the clusters of cholera cases (indicated by stacked rectangles) in the London epidemic of 1854. The map marks an important part of the development of epidemiology as a field, and of disease mapping as a whole."

Many of us know Florence as The Mother of Nursing, but she was also a statistician, and reformer. If we look at the rose diagram, we can see that the area of each coloured wedge, measured from the centre, is in proportion to the statistic it represents. The blue outer wedges represent the deaths from contagious diseases, such as cholera and typhus. The central red wedges show the deaths from wounds. The black wedges in between represent deaths from all other causes. If this rate had continued, and troops had not been replaced frequently, then disease alone would have killed the entire British Army in the Crimea. Nightingale’s graph not only dramatised the extent of the needless deaths among the soldiers during the Crimean War, but it was used as a tool to persuade Victorial government and medical profession that deaths were preventable if sanitation reforms were implemented in military and civilian hospitals."

    "text": "What is Visual Analytics?\nLearning from the history of Visual Analytics\nPlot of Napoleon’s ill-fated Russian campaign of 1812-1813 (Charles Joseph Minard,1861)\n\n\nThe last example is the famous Charles Joseph Minard’s Napoleon’s Russian campaign chart. At the first glance, it resemble the flow map but the map actually reveal more information than a common flow map. The illustration depicts Napoleon’s army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard’s interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers. This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey (9 November 1853 – 3 October 1926) used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow. Interestingly, If you take a closer look at the lower center of the graph, you will notice that the term Tableau Graphique was used.\nThe important learning lesson from these four historical data visualisation is that in order to design a functional and yet enlightening data visualisation, we need to master the science and arts of data visualisation design instead of using default graphing functions of modern data visualisation toolkit. Just like writing, by knowing how to use MS Word, you will not be able to become a great editor."

Is it to explore some data, to convey an inferential analysis, to deliver a message, convince an audience, or support a decision? It may be a mixture of these—for example, even seemingly simple exploratory plots should serve some (perhaps implicit) decision (e.g., on how to explore further). Every graph, and, more generally, every communication, must be tailored to its specific purpose."

These information can be very useful in the subsequent model building process. For example, appropriately designed visual analytics can be used to reveals if there is sign of multicolinearity.\nAfter calibrating the model, visual analytics can be used to reveal the model output for example to check if the model conform to a specific statistical assumption."

When we see data point drawn in a specific location, we tend to interpret it as a precise representation of the true value. It is difficult to conceive that a data point could actually lie somewhere it hasn’t been drawn. Yet this scenario is ubiquitous in data visualisation. Nearly every dataset we work with has some uncertainty, and whether and how we choose to represent this uncertainty can make a major difference in how accurately our audience perceives the meaning of the data.\nTwo commonly used approaches to indicate uncertainty are error bars and confidence bands. In this section, we will examine the basic concepts and design pricinples of these methods."

    "section": "Variation and Its Discontents",
    "text": "Variation and Its Discontents\nRandom and unfair comparisons\n\n\nReference: Variation and its discontents\n\n\nCentral to quantitative data analysis is an understanding of variation. When we measure multiple occurrences of things to determine how and to what extent they differ, we’re examining variation. Some variation is random and some is caused by factors that we can attempt to identify and perhaps control. Random variation consists of differences in measures that occur routinely, without a specific cause. We should note random variation and move on, because nothing can be done about it. It is noise. It tells us nothing that requires a response.\nInstances of non-random variation are signals; they tell us something useful and provide opportunities for action. Signals that indicate poor performance—an undesirable state—can perhaps be reduced by controlling the causes. Signals that indicate an especially good state of affairs can provide useful insights and opportunities for improvement.\nDespite the significance of variation, relatively few people who work with data in most organizations understand it, especially the nature of randomness. This leads to false conclusions and poor decisions, especially when comparing measures of performance within a set of like entities (e.g., countries or companies). Most organizations spend too much time examining noise: the cacophony of random variation. Learning to distinguish signals from the noise is a fundamental skill of data analysis and performance monitoring. In this article, we’ll take a look at a special version of a scatter plot, called a funnel plot (not to be confused with a funnel chart), which is designed to filter out the noise and shine a spotlight on meaningful variation when we compare performance among entities in a group. Funnel plots address the fact that entities with relatively few occurrences of the thing being measured (a small sample), when compared to entities with many occurrences (a large sample), exhibit a greater degree of random variation, which must be taken into account when comparing them. A little later we’ll take a look at this problem and the solution that funnel plots provide in relation to healthcare data, but first let’s get more familiar with the effects of sample size on randomness.\nConsider the following display (a caterpillar plot) of actual healthcare data. Each data point represents a hospital, with 260 in total. The values are mortality rates following surgeries and the solid horizontal line represents the mean.\nThe sample sizes (number of surgeries reported by each hospital) on which this graph is based range from 7 to 3,151. For this reason it isn’t appropriate to rank the hospitals by mortality rate. The ranking suggests a relationship of relative performance that cannot be determined by the data.\nImagine that, unlike the anonymous version of the graph above, each data point is labeled with the hospital’s name. Can you hear the screams of surgeons from the hospitals with the highest mortality rates in the 4th quartile section of the chart? Can you see the puffed up egos of the surgeons who work at the hospitals with mortality rates of zero in the 1st quartile section? One of the hospitals with a zero mortality rate provided a sample of only seven surgeries.\nNote: You might realize, especially if you work with healthcare data similar to the example above, that a fair comparison of hospitals would require the data to be adjusted not just to account for varying sample sizes but also for varying levels of risk. Some surgeries are more risky than others and some patients, due to varying levels of illness, are more at risk than others. We’ll ignore this for now to keep the example simple."

These information can be very useful in the subsequent model building process. For example, appropriately designed visual analytics can be used to reveals if there is sign of multicolinearity.\nAfter calibrating the model, visual analytics can be used to reveal the model output for example to check if the model conform to a specific statistical assumption."

When we see data point drawn in a specific location, we tend to interpret it as a precise representation of the true value. It is difficult to conceive that a data point could actually lie somewhere it hasn’t been drawn. Yet this scenario is ubiquitous in data visualisation. Nearly every dataset we work with has some uncertainty, and whether and how we choose to represent this uncertainty can make a major difference in how accurately our audience perceives the meaning of the data.\nTwo commonly used approaches to indicate uncertainty are error bars and confidence bands. In this section, we will examine the basic concepts and design pricinples of these methods."

    "section": "Variation and Its Discontents",
    "text": "Variation and Its Discontents\nRandom and unfair comparisons\n\n\nReference: Variation and its discontents\n\n\nCentral to quantitative data analysis is an understanding of variation. When we measure multiple occurrences of things to determine how and to what extent they differ, we’re examining variation. Some variation is random and some is caused by factors that we can attempt to identify and perhaps control. Random variation consists of differences in measures that occur routinely, without a specific cause. We should note random variation and move on, because nothing can be done about it. It is noise. It tells us nothing that requires a response.\nInstances of non-random variation are signals; they tell us something useful and provide opportunities for action. Signals that indicate poor performance—an undesirable state—can perhaps be reduced by controlling the causes. Signals that indicate an especially good state of affairs can provide useful insights and opportunities for improvement.\nDespite the significance of variation, relatively few people who work with data in most organizations understand it, especially the nature of randomness. This leads to false conclusions and poor decisions, especially when comparing measures of performance within a set of like entities (e.g., countries or companies). Most organizations spend too much time examining noise: the cacophony of random variation. Learning to distinguish signals from the noise is a fundamental skill of data analysis and performance monitoring. In this article, we’ll take a look at a special version of a scatter plot, called a funnel plot (not to be confused with a funnel chart), which is designed to filter out the noise and shine a spotlight on meaningful variation when we compare performance among entities in a group. Funnel plots address the fact that entities with relatively few occurrences of the thing being measured (a small sample), when compared to entities with many occurrences (a large sample), exhibit a greater degree of random variation, which must be taken into account when comparing them. A little later we’ll take a look at this problem and the solution that funnel plots provide in relation to healthcare data, but first let’s get more familiar with the effects of sample size on randomness.\nConsider the following display (a caterpillar plot) of actual healthcare data. Each data point represents a hospital, with 260 in total. The values are mortality rates following surgeries and the solid horizontal line represents the mean.\nThe sample sizes (number of surgeries reported by each hospital) on which this graph is based range from 7 to 3,151. For this reason it isn’t appropriate to rank the hospitals by mortality rate. The ranking suggests a relationship of relative performance that cannot be determined by the data.\nImagine that, unlike the anonymous version of the graph above, each data point is labeled with the hospital’s name. Can you hear the screams of surgeons from the hospitals with the highest mortality rates in the 4th quartile section of the chart? Can you see the puffed up egos of the surgeons who work at the hospitals with mortality rates of zero in the 1st quartile section? One of the hospitals with a zero mortality rate provided a sample of only seven surgeries.\nNote: You might realize, especially if you work with healthcare data similar to the example above, that a fair comparison of hospitals would require the data to be adjusted not just to account for varying sample sizes but also for varying levels of risk. Some surgeries are more risky than others and some patients, due to varying levels of illness, are more at risk than others. We’ll ignore this for now to keep the example simple."
