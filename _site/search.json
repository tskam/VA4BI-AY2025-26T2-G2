    "text": "Course Assessment\nThe assessment of this course consists of four major components, namely: class participation, individual assignment, DataViz Makeover, visual analytics project. There will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\n\nClass Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\nPractice makes perfect. To help students develop strong hands-on skills in designing elegant and functional data visualisations using Tableau, during lesson, students are required to complete a series of in-class exercises using Tableau. The in-class discussion will focus on how to critic existing data visualisation and how to deliver effective visual communication. In general, these exercises are guided interactively. By the end of each lesson, students are required to publish their in-class exercise on Tableau Public.\n\n\nClass Test\nThere will be two Timed Individual Assessment in the form of DataVis Makeover exercises in this course. In each exercise, one or two data visualisations will be provided. Students are required to critique the original visualisation, propose specific improvements, and redesign the visualisation accordingly. This may involve retelling the original story more effectively or uncovering a new and meaningful story within the data.\nThe objective of the makeover is to improve upon the original visualisation. Students should clearly articulate what works, what does not work, why certain design choices are ineffective, and how the revised design addresses these issues. Wherever possible, students should work within the fields of the provided dataset. However, if supplementing the data enables a clearer or more compelling narrative, this is encouraged.\nYou are required to upload the makeover onto the dropbox of e-Learn (i.e. LMS) by the end of the assessment time.\n\n\nIndividual Assignments\nThere will be two assignments that are due throughout the term. Students may work together to help one another with computer or Visual Analytics issues and discuss the materials that constitute the assignment. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the assignment (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly forbidden. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s own.\nStudents are required to edit their assignment onto the coursework website. The submission should provide a detail and accuracy descriptions of the methodology and data visualisation techniques used, and the findings of the analysis. The assignment artifact due, on the other hands, is to be uploaded into the Assignment Dropbox strictly before the official due dates. Late work, will be severely penalised. Students must check and confirm on Wiki the assignment due dates.\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students first hand experience on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page\n\n\nGrading Summary\nThe grading distribution of this course are as follows:\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeights\n\n\n\n\nClass Participation\n10%\n\n\nIndividual Assignments\n40%\n\n\nClass Tests\n10%\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\n40%\n\n\n\nThere will be final examination for this course."
